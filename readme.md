## âœ… Challenge Requirements.
URL to test: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/recalls/liberty-mountain-recalls-birdie-belay-devices-032921.html

Required tests:
- [x] Verify Disclaimer
- [x] Verify Footer Text
- [x] Assert Social Links work
- [ ] Assert "Find my match" redirects correctly
- [ ] Verify first and last links on "related news links"

## âœ¨ Assumptions

There were no requirements or expected behaviours shared with me, so I assumed the correct
behaviour is the current website behaviour.

## ðŸ’» Get Started

Before starting you need the following dependencies:
* Install `Python 3` latest version 

## ðŸš€ Installing requirements

Windows:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You could also use a virtual environment to encapsulate the project.

```
$ cd <project path>
$ python -m venv venv
$ ./venv/scripts/activate
& pip install -r requirements.txt>
```

## â˜• Running the tests

To run the tests use the following command:

```
$ pytest
```
